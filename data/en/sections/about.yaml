# a summary about you
summary: 'I have 4+ years of experience as a software developer and have recently discovered an interest in Product work. I believe my technical background and communication skills make me an effective liaison between the technical folks (developers, etc.) and the business (users, stakeholders, etc.). I enjoy working with people to understand their goals and pain points and work together to implement solutions to build a better product that is intuitive and meets their needs.'
